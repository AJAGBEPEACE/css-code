                    You just don't understand ecomomics, like supply and demand. Don't worry kiddo, where there's a demand there will be supply, we'll all have our roads

                    If i came to your house with some heavily armed buddies, demanded that you and your neighbours give me a percentage of your income, in return for some crappy monopolized services that you didn't ask for, would you consider that theft?

                    libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect their poppy fields when fully automatic weapons <br> A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated with the highest respect.
